            (η) indicates the nearness with which the considered diode behaves with respect to the ideal diode.

That is, if the diode under consideration behaves exactly as that of an ideal diode, then η will be 1. Its value increases from 1 as the difference between the behaviors of the ideal diode and diode under consideration increases: greater is the deviation, greater is the value of η.
